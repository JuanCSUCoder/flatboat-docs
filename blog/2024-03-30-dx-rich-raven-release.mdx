# v0.2.0 Rich Raven is Out!

The 0.2.0 release is focused on improving developer experience by easing auto-completion configuration, and **exec** and **ros2** command syntax. All of that, while maintaining backward compatibility of core features.

[Get Flatboat](/docs/install/)

[Go to Release (Binary Download)](https://github.com/JuanCSUCoder/flatboat-cli/releases/tag/0.2.0)

## Simplified Auto-Completion

In previous versions, it was required to manually create a completion file for your shell, and make sure it was updated. However, with this new release, a single flatboat command can be included in your `.bashrc`, `config.fish`, or almost any shell configuration file, to load and update your completions automatically.

For bash:

```bash
# Flatboat completion
source <(flatboat completion bash)
```

For fish:

```bash
# Flatboat completion
flatboat completion fish | source
```

## Simplified ROS2 and Exec Commands

In previous versions, it was required to use quotation marks on `flatboat ros2` and `flatboat exec` commands, to pass the arguments inside the devcontainer. However, in this new release, you can just continue writing the command without any other special indication.

For example:

```bash
# Previous version
flatboat ros2 "run turtlesim turtlesim_node"

# Now
flatboat ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

```bash
# Previous version
flatboat exec "echo Hello"

# Now
flatboat exec echo Hello
```

## Custom Template Images for Workspace Creation

Flatboat now allows the creation of workspaces by selecting one from the default template repository or using a custom one provided by its container registry URL. 

To do so, you can use the following syntax:

```bash
Usage: flatboat workspace create <WS_NAME> [WS_IMAGE]
```

For example:

```bash
flatboat workspace create ros2_ws iron_nogpu
```

Output:

```bash
...
INFO  flatboat::features::workspace > Trying to pull from ghcr.io/JuanCSUCoder/flatboat-templates/roboten_ws_iron_nogpu ...
...
```

Or:

```bash
flatboat workspace create ros2_ws GitHubUser/my_own_templates/template_name
```

Output:

```bash
...
INFO  flatboat::features::workspace > Trying to pull from ghcr.io/GitHubUser/my_own_templates/template_name ...
...
```
