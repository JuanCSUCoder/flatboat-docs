# Welcome to Flatboat Documentation

Hello, you are seeing the brand new Flatboat documentation. Flatboat is an open-source project started at Robotics and Automation Society group at the Pontifical Xavierian University. It aims to aid developers on building robotics applications inside containers with almost full device, network and graphical support.

Today I am starting to develop the documentation for the final launch of this project. So stay tuned!
