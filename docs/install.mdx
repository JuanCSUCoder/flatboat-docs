# Install Flatboat

Flatboat only works on Linux based systems, compatible with **Docker Engine**.

## Install the Dependencies

### Install Docker Engine

The main thing required to run **Flatboat** is the **Docker Engine**. Alternative container engines like *Podman* may work, but **are not officially supported**.

You can install **Docker** following the instructions on their [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

- It's not recommended to use a Docker rootless installation.
- It's recommended to add your `$USER` to `docker` group.

### Install NodeJS and NPM

The next thing is **NodeJS** runtime for javascript applications and **NPM** for installing packages. You can download these command-line tools from the following sources:

- Official Download from [NodeJS Website](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Alternative Download for Ubuntu/Debian based systems from [NodeSource (Ubuntu/Debian)](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions?tab=readme-ov-file#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions)
- Other installation options from [NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions?tab=readme-ov-file)

:::warning
It is possible in the future that NodeJS removes NPM from its default installation, which may require another installation.
:::

### Install Devcontainer packages

Devcontainer is an specification created by Microsoft for development inside containers, which is used by **Flatboat**. Therefore, is required to install with the following command:

```bash
npm i -g @devcontainers/cli
```

### Install Rust and Cargo

**Flatboat** is developed in *Rust programming language*, and published on [*crates.io*](https://crates.io/crates/flatboat). So in order to install it the **Cargo** package manager is required, and can be installed with the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

When prompted, is recommended to choose the **default installation**.

## Run the Command

Install Flatboat with `cargo`

```bash
  cargo install flatboat
```

```bash
