However, with this new release, a single flatboat command can be included in your `.bashrc`, `config.fish`, or almost any shell configuration file, to load and update your completions automatically.\\n\\nFor bash:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Flatboat completion\\nsource <(flatboat completion bash)\\n```\\n\\nFor fish:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Flatboat completion\\nflatboat completion fish | source\\n```\\n\\n## Simplified ROS2 and Exec Commands\\n\\nIn previous versions, it was required to use quotation marks on `flatboat ros2` and `flatboat exec` commands, to pass the arguments inside the devcontainer. However, in this new release, you can just continue writing the command without any other special indication.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Previous version\\nflatboat ros2 \\"run turtlesim turtlesim_node\\"\\n\\n# Now\\nflatboat ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\n# Previous version\\nflatboat exec \\"echo Hello\\"\\n\\n# Now\\nflatboat exec echo Hello\\n```\\n\\n## Custom Template Images for Workspace Creation\\n\\nFlatboat now allows the creation of workspaces by selecting one from the default template repository or using a custom one provided by its container registry URL. \\n\\nTo do so, you can use the following syntax:\\n\\n```bash\\nUsage: flatboat workspace create <WS_NAME> [WS_IMAGE]\\n```\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```bash\\nflatboat workspace create ros2_ws iron_nogpu\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```bash\\n...\\nINFO  flatboat::features::workspace > Trying to pull from ghcr.io/JuanCSUCoder/flatboat-templates/roboten_ws_iron_nogpu ...\\n...\\n```\\n\\nOr:\\n\\n```bash\\nflatboat workspace create ros2_ws GitHubUser/my_own_templates/template_name\\n```\\n\\nOutput:\\n\\n```bash\\n...\\nINFO  flatboat::features::workspace > Trying to pull from ghcr.io/GitHubUser/my_own_templates/template_name ...\\n...\\n```"},{"id":"/2024/03/15/welcome-to-flatboat-docs","metadata":{"permalink":"/flatboat-docs/blog/2024/03/15/welcome-to-flatboat-docs","editUrl":"https://github.com/JuanCSUCoder/flatboat-docs/tree/main/blog/2024-03-15-welcome-to-flatboat-docs.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-15-welcome-to-flatboat-docs.mdx","title":"Welcome to Flatboat Documentation!","description":"Hello, you are seeing the brand new Flatboat documentation.
